# ðŸš€ Welcome to the JavaScript Deployment Quest!

Greetings, brave developers! ðŸŒŸ Today, we're setting off on an epic journey into the realm of deployment magic. Get ready to witness your backend code embark on a thrilling adventure to find its new home in the enchanted land of Vercel.

## ðŸŒˆ Chapter 1: Crafting the Magical Vercel Configuration

Once upon a time, our backend code needed a special map to navigate the cloud kingdom. This map was known as the "vercel.json" configuration fileâ€”a powerful talisman that held the secrets of deployment. Here's the magical incantation:

```js
/*
  vercel.json
  Do not modify this file
*/
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
      {
          "src": "./index.js",
          "use": "@vercel/node"
      }
  ],
  "routes": [
      {
          "src": "/(.*)",
          "dest": "/"
      }
  ]
}
```

With the map in hand, our backend code fortified its powers with a special enchantment in its "package.json" file:

```json
"engines": {
    "node" : "16.x"
}
```

Oh, and before I forget, our intrepid adventurers, please make sure to update the Node version to 16.x in the "engines" section. It's like giving your code a shiny new sword for the quest!

## ðŸš€ Chapter 2: The Gateway to Vercel Castle

Our backend code approached the mighty castle of Vercel, where it would find its new home. Here's how the brave deployment happened:

1. **Login:** The code presented its credentials by logging into Vercel.
2. **Connect with GitHub:** A magical bond was formed by connecting with the GitHub oracle.
3. **Import Project:** The code brought its essence to Vercel by importing the magical project.
4. **Env Variables:** To unlock the doors of the kingdom, the code whispered secret environment variables and their values.
5. **Deploy:** With a wave of the magic wand (or a click of the "Deploy" button), our backend code was whisked away to the cloud.

And there it was, in the cloud kingdom of Vercel, serving requests and spreading joy across the web.

## ðŸŒŒ Conclusion: A Happy Ending in the Cloud Kingdom

And so, our backend code found its new home, living happily ever after in the cloud. The deployment quest was a success, thanks to the magical powers of Vercel.

May your future deployments be as enchanting as this journey! ðŸš€âœ¨

Stay magical and keep coding! ðŸŒŸ
